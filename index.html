      <h2>who am I?</h2>
      <p>
        Professionally, I am a creative, dedicated person who loves sharing and learning. Outside of work, I am all of that and a down to earth person who loves understanding people.
      </p>

      <p>
        According to <a href="https://personalitylingo.com/free-communication-style-quiz/" target="_blank">personalitylingo.com</a>, I am a connector. And after taking the Myers-Briggs personality test, I found out I'm an ENTP.

          In 2024 I started playing co-op games with my friends like Leathal Company and I started to look for other co-op game. It got to a point where I was telling my friends abut so many co-op games they eventually said: "make a website, we can't keep track." So I did. (most images aren't my work)

        <p>
          Since 2022 I've kept a document on my phone where I've added movies I've watched, because my family was alwase asking me for movie suggestions. Eventually I couldn't keep up with maintanence of the doc so I thought it could be a website where I can show how good I think the movie is, wht tags I gave it and if I recomend it.
