      <h2>who am I?</h2>
      <p>
        Professionally, I am a creative, dedicated person who loves sharing and learning. Outside of work, I am all of that and a down to earth person who loves understanding people.
      </p>

      <h3>professional identity</h3>

      <p>
        According to <a href="https://personalitylingo.com/free-communication-style-quiz/" target="_blank">personalitylingo.com</a>, I am a connector. And after taking the Myers-Briggs personality test, I found out I'm an ENTP. Outside of this, I feel sometimes I struggle with social cues and situations, but I am actively working on this and growing to be a better person. In the future, I hope to grow my skills with React and gain more experience in the workplace. I love to explore and understand, and I'm always eager to learn.
      </p>

      <h3>personal identity</h3>

      <p>
        Personally, I like to goof around and play. I find value in fun activities for their health benefits and the experiences that come along with them. I get distracted a lot, and I love to present. I host an intellectual activity every 6 months, where, if people are willing, I challenge my friends to think differently in a sort of game show where the audience can change the game. I love helping others, even if I have to go out of my way to do it. I hope this sums me up, but I'm sure you'll learn way more in person.
      </p>

              In 2024 I started playing co-op games with my friends like Lethal Company and I started to look for other co-op games. It got to a point where I was telling my friends about so many co-op games they eventually said: "Make a website, we can't keep track." So I did. Along the way I user-tested and found that one of the things people didn't like was that the theme didn't match the audience; so I added a dark mode toggle and set it to dark by default, I also changed the cards to pink instead of dark blue to make them pop. (most images aren't my work in this project)

              In 2023 I wanted to try and make a web game - I got decently far but due to school and other events I couldn't find the time to get this project out of the idea phase. You can click around and the squares do change color but that's about it. (all images are my work in this project)

              Since 2022 I've kept a document on my phone where I've added movies I've watched, because my family was always asking me for movie suggestions. Eventually I couldn't keep up with maintanence of the doc so I thought it could be a website where I can show how good I think the movie is, what tags I gave it and if I recommend it. I haven't stopped getting feedback and making changes; recently I changed the cards from being either red, yellow, or green to, instead, being a color based on how much I recommend it based on an algorithm. What sets this project apart from my others is I made a database and the website is grabbing data through an api. This will allow me to keep it maintained and updated easily, unlike my co-op games website. (most images aren't my work in this project)

              I conducted a survey in class asking people about their public speaking skils 40% of respondents (45 in total) said they were either not confident or somewhat not confident. Despite this 96% of them publicly spoke frequently or more. This means that a large portion are leaving bad impressions when forced to publicly speak. When asked how people prepared the most common answer by far was people wrote a script. SCRIPTLESS was born. A web app to help you write, remember and practice your scripts.

              A client reached out to me for a logo for their new company Bluero Spades, a t-shirt brand from what I could tell. They told me they wanted a graffiti logo with a spade instead of the "A" They loved what I came up with and I'm proud of it too. This showcases my ability to create designs, not just code.
