      <h2>who am I?</h2>
      <p>
        Professionally, I am a creative, dedicated person who loves sharing and learning. Outside of work, I am all of that and a down to earth person who loves understanding people.
      </p>

      <h3>profesinal identity</h3>

      <p>
        According to <a href="https://personalitylingo.com/free-communication-style-quiz/" target="_blank">personalitylingo.com</a>, I am a connector. And after taking the Myers-Briggs personality test, I found out I'm an ENTP. Outside of this, I feel sometimes I struggle with social cues and situations, but I am actively working on this and growing to be a better person. In the future, I hope to grow my skills with React and gain more experience in the workplace. I love to explore and understand, and I'm always eager to learn.
      </p>

      <h3>personal identity</h3>

      <p>
        Personally, I like to goof around and play. I find value in fun activities for their health benefits and the experiences that come along with them. I get distracted a lot, and I love to present. I host an intellectual activity every 6 months, where, if people are willing, I challenge my friends to think differently in a sort of game show where the audience can change the game. I love helping others, even if I have to go out of my way to do it. I hope this sums me up, but I'm sure you'll learn way more in person.
      </p>

              In 2024 I started playing co-op games with my friends like Leathal Company and I started to look for other co-op game. It got to a point where I was telling my friends abut so many co-op games they eventually said: "make a website, we can't keep track." So I did. Along the way I user tested and found that one of things people didn't like was that the theme didn't match the audince. So I added a dark mode toggle and set it to dark by defalt, I also changed the cards to pink instead of dark blue to make them pop.(most images aren't my work in this project)

            <p>
              Since 2022 I've kept a document on my phone where I've added movies I've watched, because my family was alwase asking me for movie suggestions. Eventually I couldn't keep up with maintanence of the doc so I thought it could be a website where I can show how good I think the movie is, wht tags I gave it and if I recomend it. I haven't stopped getting feedback and making changes; recently I changed the cards from being either red yellow or green to instead being a color based on how much I recomend it based on an algorithum. What sets this project appart from my otherts is I made a database and the website is grabbing data through an api. This will allow me to keep it maintaingd and updated easly, unlike my co-op games website. (most images aren't my work in this project)
